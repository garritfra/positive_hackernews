# Positive Hacker News RSS Feed

A writeup of this project can be found [here](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-11-24-positive-hackernews).

## Overview

This RSS feed curates positive news stories from Hacker News.

By using sentiment analysis, it filters out negative stories and presents a selection of content that won't make tech feel hopeless and miserable. This offers an alternative to the standard Hacker News feed for those seeking more positive tech news.
